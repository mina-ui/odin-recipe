        <h2>Bologna Cake Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the cream cheese in a large bowl. Stir in the onion powder using a spatula.</li>
            <li>Take one slice of bologna and pat it dry with paper towels; place it on a plate.</li>
            <li>With the use of an offset spatula, spread a layer of the cream cheese mixture on top of the bologna.</li>
            <li>Add another slice of bologna, patted dry with paper towels, and spread about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture on <br> top. Repeat the process until you run out of bologna slices.</li>
            <li>Spread the remaining cream cheese mixture onto the sides and top of the bologna cake.</li>
            <li>If you would like to decorate your cake, you can cut the tip out of a piping bag or the corner of a zip-top bag, add a piping <br> dip, and fill it with Cheese Whiz.</li>
            <li>Finally, pipe the Cheese Whiz on top of the cake. Then, slice and serve immediately.</li>
